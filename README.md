# torrent-indexer

This is a simple torrent indexer that can be used to index torrents from HTML pages. It is written in Golang and uses Redis as a cache.

## Test it

Visit [https://torrent-indexer.darklyn.org/](https://torrent-indexer.darklyn.org/) to test it.

## Supported sites

- [comando-torrents](https://comando.la/)
- [bludv](https://bludvfilmes.tv/)

## Deploy

If you have Docker + docker-compose installed, you can deploy it using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipemarinho97/torrent-indexer/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

The server will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Integrating with Jackett

You can integrate this indexer with Jackett by adding a new Torznab custom indexer. Here is an example of how to do it for the `bludv` indexer:

```yaml
---
id: bludv_indexer
name: BluDV Indexer

    category:
      text: "{{ if .Result.category_is_tv_show }}TV{{ else }}Movie{{ end }}"
# json engine n/a
```

# Warning

The instance running at [https://torrent-indexer.darklyn.org/](https://torrent-indexer.darklyn.org/) is my personal instance and it is not guaranteed to be up all the time. Also, for better availability, I recommend deploying your own instance because the Cloudflare protection may block requests from indexed sites if too many requests are made in a short period of time from the same IP.

If I notice that the instance is being used a lot, I may block requests from Jackett to avoid overloading the server without prior notice.
